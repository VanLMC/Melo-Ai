AI-powered melody generation system built with **React**, **Node.js**, and **Magenta.js**.  
This project was developed as my **Computer Science capstone (TCC)** and explores how artificial intelligence can boost **creativity in music composition**.

## 🚀 About the Project
Melo-AI helps composers, producers, and artists overcome **creative block** by generating unique melodies through machine learning.  
It can:
- Generate melodies with pure AI models (MusicVAE).
- Create melodies influenced by **specific composers/artists** via **MidiMe** training.
- Produce algorithmic melodies based on scales and randomness.
- Export results as **MIDI files** for use in any DAW.

The system mixes **cutting-edge AI** with a **user-friendly web interface**, making it a practical creative assistant rather than just a research prototype.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, MUI, Styled Components, React Spring, React Beautiful DnD  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express  
- **AI:** [Magenta.js](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/js) (MusicVAE, MidiMe)  
- **MIDI Processing:** midi-writer-js  

## ✨ Features
- 🎼 Generate melodies using different AI strategies  
- 🎹 Visualize results with an interactive piano roll  
- 🎧 Play generated sequences in-browser  
- 💾 Download as MIDI for seamless DAW integration  
- 🔀 Combine influences of multiple artists for unique results  

## 📐 Architecture
- **Frontend (React):** Handles user interaction, melody visualization, and AI training (MidiMe runs client-side).  
- **Backend (Node.js/Express):** Stores and serves MIDI files used for training.  
- **Deployment:** Hosted on [Render](https://render.com).  

## 🎓 Academic Context
This project was developed as my **Bachelor’s thesis in Computer Science (2023)** at UniCarioca.  
The focus: how **artificial intelligence can augment human creativity** and serve as a tool for modern music production.

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Admin panel for uploading new artists and MIDI datasets  
- Cloud storage integration (e.g., AWS S3) for scalability  
- Enhanced UI/UX for producers and musicians
